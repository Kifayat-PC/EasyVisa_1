# 🛂 EasyVisa: Visa Approval Prediction Using Ensemble Techniques  
## 💡 Smart Automation for Foreign Labor Certification

**EasyVisa** is a machine learning solution designed to assist the **Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC)** in the U.S. in predicting visa approval outcomes. With a surge in foreign labor certification applications, the project leverages ensemble techniques to optimize and automate decision-making.

### 🌟 Project Highlights

#### 🔍 Objective  
- Predict whether a visa application should be **certified** or **denied**  
- Understand the **key factors** driving approvals  
- Enable **data-driven recommendations** for future applicants  

---

### 🧰 Skills and Tools Used  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
- **Customer Profiling**  
- **Ensemble Learning**:  
  - Bagging: Random Forest  
  - Boosting: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost  
  - Stacking Classifier (meta-learning)  
- **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib**  

---

### 🏛️ Problem Context  
U.S. businesses increasingly depend on skilled foreign workers. The **OFLC** ensures visa approval only when employers show a lack of local candidates at fair wages. In **FY 2016**, over **775,000 applications** were processed — necessitating a scalable, intelligent system like **EasyVisa** to support workload and fairness.

### 📂 Dataset Overview  
> **Note:** Dataset is private and cannot be publicly shared due to confidentiality agreements.  

#### Key Features Include:  
- `education_of_employee`  
- `has_job_experience`  
- `requires_job_training`  
- `region_of_employment`  
- `prevailing_wage`, `unit_of_wage`  
- `full_time_position`  
- `case_status` (**Target Variable**)  

---

### 📊 EDA Highlights  

**Exploratory Questions Answered:**  
1. Does education level affect visa approval?  
2. Is prior job experience linked to higher approval rates?  
3. Which wage units are more likely to get certified?  
4. How does prevailing wage impact approval probability?  
5. What is the geographic pattern of visa decisions?

### 📈 Key Findings
- Job experience and full-time employment strongly influence approval odds
- Yearly wage unit applications show higher success rates
- Higher prevailing wages improve chances of certification
- Stacking Classifier provided the best generalization across test data

### 📚 What I Learned
- Practical application of ensemble learning techniques in real-world classification problems
- Importance of feature impact analysis to derive actionable insights for stakeholders
- Hands-on experience with stacking classifiers to improve model generalization
- Improved understanding of wage normalization, handling imbalanced classes, and encoding strategies
- Developed storytelling skills through EDA and visual communication for business audiences

### 🚀 How This Project Helped Me Grow
- Boosted my ability to work with complex, confidential datasets and draw useful conclusions
- Helped me think like a data consultant, balancing predictive accuracy with real-world interpretability
- Strengthened my machine learning workflow, from preprocessing to deployment-ready models
- Reinforced the value of domain knowledge when designing data features and understanding outputs

### ✅ Business Value
EasyVisa can assist government agencies and large organizations by:
- Reducing manual workload through automated recommendation systems
- Improving fairness and transparency in visa approval processes
- Enhancing efficiency in handling large-scale application data
- Providing data-backed guidance for future applicants to increase approval chances
- Minimizing operational delays and accelerating skilled labor acquisition for U.S. businesses
